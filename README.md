# Undeniably Sizable Space Rocks Radar (USSRR)

In April 2018, the [B612 Foundation][b612-link] 
reported that ["It is 100 percent certain we'll be hit [by a devastating asteroid], but we're not 100 percent sure when"][quote-src]. 

So is today the big day?   
Is today finally the day the Earth gets *d'asteroid*? (Get it? *destroyed* lmao)   
Is it time to play *I Don't Want to Miss a Thing* on repeat whilst Bruce Willis 
blows up a big space rock? (Get it? *Armageddon* reference lmao)   
Worry no more as USSRR* answers all these questions for you!

## Details
### What
USSRR is an app for discovering undeniably sizable space rocks (aka. asteroids) 
that are orbiting a little too close to our beloved home planet.

### Where
Check out the demo [here](https://ussrr-zandrexrc.netlify.app/).

### How
This app is made possible by [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/). 
Asteroid data is fetched from the Asteroids NeoWS API, and the cover image comes 
from the Astronomy Picture of the Day API.

### Who
This project is created by [Zandrex Camagon](https://zandrexrc.me). Published 
under the MIT License.

### Why
No particular reason tbh. I was just browsing through NASA's list of APIs and 
the idea just struck me.
